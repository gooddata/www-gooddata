NAME
    WWW::GoodData - Client library for GoodData REST-ful API

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::GoodData;
      my $gdc = new WWW::GoodData;
      print $gdc->get_uri ('md', { title => 'My Project' });

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::GoodData is the client for GoodData JSON-based API built atop
    WWW::GoodData::Agent client agent, with focus on usefullness and
    correctness of implementation.

    It provides code for navigating the REST-ful API structure as well as
    wrapper funcitons for common actions.

METHODS
    new [PARAMS]
        Create a new client instance.

        You can optionally pass a hash reference with properties that would
        be blessed, otherwise a new one is created. Possible properties
        include:

        agent   A WWW::GoodData::Agent instance to use.

        retries A number of retries to obtain results of asynchronous tasks,
                such as report exports or data uploads. See poll.

                Defaults to 3600 (delay of one hour).

    links PATH
        Traverse the links in resource hierarchy following given PATH,
        starting from API root ("gdc" by default).

        PATH is an array of dictionaries, where each key-value pair matches
        properties of a link. If a plain string is specified, it is
        considered to be a match against category property:

          $gdc->links ('md', { 'category' => 'projects' });

        The above call returns a list of all projects, with links to their
        metadata resources.

    get_uri PATH
        Follows the same samentics as links() call, but returns an URI of
        the first matching resource instead of complete link structure.

    login EMAIL PASSWORD
        Obtain a SST (login token).

    logout
        Make server invalidate the client session and drop credential
        tokens.

        Is called upon destruction of the GoodData client instance.

    change_passwd OLD NEW
        Change user password given the old and new password.

    projects
        Return array of links to project resources on metadata server.

    delete_project IDENTIFIER
        Delete a project given its identifier.

    create_project TITLE SUMMARY TEMPLATE DRIVER TOKEN
        Create a project given its title and optionally summary, project
        template, db engine driver and authorization token return its
        identifier.

        The list of valid project templates is available from the template
        server: <https://secure.gooddata.com/projectTemplates/>.

        Valid db engine drivers are 'Pg' (default) and 'mysql'.

    create_user DOMAIN EMAIL LOGIN PASSWORD FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME PHONE
    COMPANY SSO_PROVIDER
        Create a user given its email, login, password, first name, surname,
        phone and optionally company, sso provider in domain.

    get_roles PROJECT
        Gets project roles.

        Return array of project roles.

    reports PROJECT
        Return array of links to repoort resources on metadata server.

    compute_report REPORT
        Trigger a report computation and return the URI of the result
        resource.

    export_report REPORT FORMAT
        Submit an exporter task for a computed report (see compute_report),
        wait for completion and return raw data in desired format.

    ldm_picture PROJECT

    ldm_manage PROJECT MAQL
        Execute MAQL statement for a project.

    upload PROJECT MANIFEST

    poll BODY CONDITION
        Should only be used internally.

        Run BODY passing its return value to call to CONDITION until it
        evaluates to true or retries (see properties) times out.

        Returns value is of last iteration of BODY in case CONDITION
        succeeds, otherwise undefined (in case of timeout).

    create_object_with_expression PROJECT URI TYPE TITLE SUMMARY EXPRESSION
